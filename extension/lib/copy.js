- the text you can see, the text you'd see by scrolling, text in background tabs, some labels pages provide for screen readers and tooltips, and text the page has but doesn't show you
- each page's address, without anything after a ? or #, its title, when you were on it, and the sites its links point to
- on a mail or chat site you add, your messages
- some words you've typed but haven't sent, and anything a site shows, even something you'd consider secret, like a code in an email

never pixels. never raw HTML. never a site you didn't add.

where it goes: nothing leaves this browser except to the solstone app on this computer. from there it goes into your journal over the link the solstone app already uses.

the solstone extension doesn't run in private windows. that covers this extension only.

pause any time in the solstone extension, or pause the solstone app to stop everything at once. pausing doesn't hold back what's already taken in. if you remove a site, nothing new comes from it; what's already in your journal stays there.
